Project by Justin Ventura.
Dr. Joseph Anderson

## Application Information

There are two executables included: linearleastsquares.exe and matrixDriver.exe

### Extra Credit

I did my best on making the code as efficient as possible in terms of run-time and memory usage.  I also checked for memeory leaks with valgrind and have found none.
