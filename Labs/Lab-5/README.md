# COSC320 Lab-5 [Joe Anderson]

by Justin Ventura

## Questions to answer:

### A) Summarize your approach to the problem, and how your code addresses the abstractions needed.

### B) What is the theoretical time complexity of your algorithms (best and worst case), in terms of the input size? Be sure to vary the parameters enough to use the observations to answer the next questions!

### C) How does the absolute timing of different algorithms scale with the input? Use the data collected to rectify this with the theoretical time complexity, e.g. what non-asymptotic function of n mostly closely matches the timings that you observe as n grows?

### D) Describe 2-3 different larger application areas where a priority queue would be helpful. Explain and give some justification why it would be a better choice than other data structures.

### E) How could the code be improved in terms of usability, efficiency, and robustness?
