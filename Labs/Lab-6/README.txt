README in .txt becuase my old readme was deleted and github has no history for markdown files because its worthless.

A) I used the code we went over in lecture and also the code from previous labs for the sorts.  This did not take much planning.

B) HIRE ASSISTANT: Best case O(1hire), worst: O(n hires) for n candidates.  Each sort had an average case of O(nlogn), but quick and rand quick had a worst case of O(n^2), with rand quick being slightly better.  In general, merge and heapsort were pretty fast and were not affected much by the inputs, but quick and rand quick were sensitive to the ordering and did not do well with arrays that were close to pre/backward sorted arrays.

C) Hire assistant was sort of logarithmic in growth, and was nowhere near its worst case.  The sorts were relatively close to O(nlogn) except for quick sort which was closer to O(n^2).
