# COSC320 Lab-9

by Justin Ventura

## Questions to Answer:

### A) Summarize your approach to the problem, and how your code addresses the abstractions needed.

See part D for the full information on this lab.  This was a very tough lab to complete and most of it had me rely on the text and notes in order to complete the algorithms.

### B) What is the theoretical time complexity of your algorithms (best and worst case), in terms of the size of the tree? Be sure to vary the parameters enough to use the observations to answer the next questions!

I hope to make up for the trash code with my analysis on the theoretical side.  I understand most of this theoretically, but I my coding was mediocre.  The nice thing about Red-Black Tree's is that with their balancing properties, you will never end up with a skewed tree (linked list-like structure) like seen with the BST.  The 5 properties allow for the insert/delete algorithms to be very quick, O(logn) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. to be precise.  This is what makes RBT's so fast.  After multiple tests, I noticed that the timing was incredibly fast compared to my BST for the insert.  

### C) Use timing tools to study the cost of each of the data structure algorithms. Does the data align with the theoretical guarantees?

Yes the data aligns well.  It is very quick as expected.

### D) How could the code be improved in terms of usability, efficiency, and robustness?

This is the first time I've ever had a lab in which nothing went in my favor.  I had some internet outages due to storms during a few lectures which is probably why my understanding of the code for RBT's is so skewed.  I understand them from a theoretical standpoint, and have always been more of a mathmatical/theoretical person than a coder.  I admit that this lab was subpar in performance and have no excuses.  Some of my functions did work as they should have, even though I used the algorithms from the book and text.  I am unsure how things didn't work, but I am just aware that they didn't.  There were no memory errors and I have an understanding of what is happening from a theoretical standpoint, but alas my code was insufficient.  I am hoping to get most of the credit for this lab, but I also admit it is very subpar.  I hope you can understand as I have never had a more inconvenient situation with everything going on here, but no excuses.  Still trying to get an A in the class but this lab was very difficult for me.
