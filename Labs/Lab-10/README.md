# COSC320 Lab-10

by Justin Ventura for JTA @ SU.

## Questions to Answer

### A) Summarize your approach to the problem, and how your code addresses the abstractions needed.

### B) What is the theoretical time complexity of your algorithms (best and worst case), in terms of the size of the tree? Be sure to vary the parameters enough to use the observations to answer the next questions!

### C) How could the code be improved in terms of usability, efficiency, and robustness?
