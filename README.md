# COSC320 with Dr. Joe T. Anderson

Justin Ventura's Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis Repository.


One of the many things I do enjoy about Dr. Anderson's labs & projects is that they are very open ended in the sense that there are many features/analysis' in which we are not required to do, (some of them do give bonus points but not all) however they are a good enrichment for us as students in computer science.  Many consider school-related projects to be of little worth, but I beg to differ.  A lot of my work in this repository is unique not only from other students, but while not perfect, they are good examples of my abilities to solve problems, then summarize & analyze the solution and abstractions required.  I only say this because I feel that as a young and new programmer, I may have skills in which are not shown anywhere else due to my lack of work-experience as an underclassman :)

## Projects

### Wassily Leontief's Input-Output Model (Applied Linear Algebra)

Notable Features & Algorithms:
- Matrix Data Structure & Formatting.
- General Matrix Operations: add/subtract, matrix multiplication, scalar multiplication.
- Strassen's Algorithm for matrix multiplication.
- Matrix Inversion (Co-Factor & Determinant calculations for determining singularity).
- See the README for more information.

### Spell Checker based on a Hashed Dictionary (Hash Table & SpellCheck)

Notable Features & Algorithms:
- Hash Table with Chaining (doubly list).
- A perfect Hashing function.
- Python Script made to find prime numbers for my hash.
- Spell Checking (parsed string) within 1 & 2 edit distances.
- Highlights incorrect words then displays suggestions.

### Some sort of graphing problem
